# Pos Printing Systems Backend 

## Introduction
Welcome to the "# Pos Printing Systems Backend in MERN Stack" repository! This repository focuses on developing the server-side component of a point-of-sale (POS) printing system using the ME (MongoDB, Express.js). The backend provides the necessary APIs for handling print requests, interacting with the printer, and managing the printing system's configuration.




## Getting Started
To get started with the POS printing system backend in the MERN stack, follow these steps:

1. Clone or download the repository to your local development environment.

2. Set up the backend server by navigating to the backend directory, installing dependencies, and configuring the necessary environment variables.

3. Configure the MongoDB connection settings in the backend server to establish a connection with the database.

4. Start the backend server by running the appropriate command (`nodemon`).

5. Access the backend APIs using tools like Postman or integrate them with the frontend client to enable communication between the client and the printer.
